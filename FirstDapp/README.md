# First DApp project

This project contains the following tools:
  - Remix
  - Ganache
  - Metamask

## **Remix**
Remix is an online integrated development environment for creating smart contracts

## **Ganache**
Ganache helps building and testing applications using local own blockchain

## **Metamask**
Metamask is a browser extension that brings Ethereum into the browser

## **1. Connecting to Remix**
First thing is going to Remix and copying the code to a file called myMessage.sol (Solidity extension):

In order to change the Web3 provider endpoint so it can be used Ganache, on Remix after doing step 2 it'll be shown the following:

## **4. Getting the information from Remix to use on code**
In order to use the values of ABI and Address of the account, it's required to copy those from Remix.
Copying the ABI can be done as follows:

Then copying the Address of the acccount can be done like below:

**IMPORTANT**: Both ABI and Address account can be obtained using the [Etherscan website](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)

## **5. Creating the network in Metamask**
Now it's needed to create a Custom RPC, click on Custom RPC which can be seen below:

After that, fill the required fields which are Network name, New RPC URL and Chain ID.
**RPC URL** is the one from Ganache: HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545
**Chain ID** is the id returned from the network in Ganache (in my case 1337)

After filling the fields, hit Save

Then, go to My Accounts and click in Import account:

![Screenshot](docs/metamask_import_account.png)

On Ganache, go to Accounts and click in the key (Show keys) of one of the listed accounts:

![Screenshot](docs/ganache_show_keys.png)

Copy the private key from the window that pops up

On Metamask, paste it on the field "Paste your private key string here"

It should show the same value in Ether of the account on Ganache
