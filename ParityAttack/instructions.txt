Steps to reproduce the attack

- Pay attention to the fallback function
- The fallback function will be called anytime you make a call to the contract with a function name that doesn't exist 
    within the contract
    - When calling that non existing function, it will default to calling this fallback function
    - What someone can do in this case is call the Wallet contract with the name of the function that only exists in the library
    - Since that call doesn't exist in the Wallet, it would default to the fallback function which delegates this call
      to the library
    - If the name of the function is addOwner, you can supply it with your address. You just made yourself the owner of
      this wallet. From there you can drain the funds from the wallet or transfer to another wallet that you own
